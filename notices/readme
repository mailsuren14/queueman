==My Stance==
*Queueman's Logo, Name, and screens were all approved previously by Netflix's* (then) app review process. 

I have provided Netflix, via the complaintent, with the previous record of approval seeking clarification -- but have no intentions to fight their request.  Queueman was built in a time when no other solutions existed.  I worked closely with many supportive people from Netflix and the developer community in their now defunct dev forums.

Since that time Netflix has released their own application, and I can respect their reasons (brand confusion, etc) to not have other Netflix application in the market. I disagree with their approach (My email -is- was published alongside the application in Google Play). 

The source code remains free and open (and in use in some other Netflix Queue apps on the market).  checkout or browse to /trunk.

*Thank you to the faithful users and supporters.*
