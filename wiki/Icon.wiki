And I have to admit I like it.

But in the spirit of collaborative software, I am opening this up to a vote.

If you like the new icon, vote here.
If you want to keep the old one, vote here.

Finally, if you think you can design a totally boss icon, than go for it! just email me ot post a ticket with your result.

Thanks to all who participate.
