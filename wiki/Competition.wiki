= Introduction =

As a solo developer I was a bit slow to market. IN that time another app entered the market, and carved a nice niche. Discouraged but hopeful I pressed on, releasing the first (and quite buggy) version of QueueMan.

Today, after many releases and great user feedback I have a better story to share.

5 Stars! Alright, glad that QueueMan is maturing into a favorable solution.
