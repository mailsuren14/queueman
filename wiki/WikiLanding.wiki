== Eclair Compatibility ==
Unfortunately !QueueMan's lazy developer hasn't gotten around to installing the 2.0 SDK and making the changes necessary for a version compatible with the latest SDK release.

Please be patient as he gets around to it, or try coaxing him with sweets or other incentives.

*Update* 
!QueueMan seems to running on the 2.0 SDK just fine on my local emulator. Looking into the reports this may be an issue with a specific device (all confirmed reports are using motorola Droid)
