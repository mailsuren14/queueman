== Eclair Compatibility ==
QueueMan is now *logically* on board with the Eclair SDK (2.0, 2.01, 2.1). (Visually some devices may not look nice - see below)



== Fancy Screen Compatibility ==
Fancy phones like Droid and Nexus One don't play very nice with any of the rating bars. I am not sure what the dilly is.  Please stay tuned as I am working actively to fix this!

(If your some Android Layout Guru - well c'mon help out! )
